# Workshop - How to Capture Stack Overflow Exception
## Environment setup

First of all, click the [Deploy to Azure](https://github.com/lancenty/StackOverflowReproSite) button on the README page of [this workshop's GitHub repository](https://github.com/lancenty/StackOverflowReproSite).

![The deploy to azure button](the-deploy-to-azure-button.png)

Follow the wizard to provision the resource.

![Wizard](deploy-to-azure.png)

After the deployment is done, a resource group will be created with the following resource items:
* An app service plan
* An app service site

![Resources](resources.jpg)

In order to repro the Stack Overflow exception in the site, we can browse `/Repro/StackOverflow` of the site, or use the StackOverflow tab on top navbar.

![Repro](repro.jpg)

 It will do an infinite recursion, which will cause the site to crash immediately. We will see the page loading and then 502 error page in the browser.

![Error Page](error-page.jpg)

The backend code is straight forward. You can read it [here](https://github.com/lancenty/StackOverflowReproSite/blob/master/StackOverflow/Controllers/ReproController.cs).

## Profile the .Net core process
On the Azure portal, in the **"Diagnose and Solve Problems" (DaaS)** blade, in the **"Diagnostic Tools"** tile, let's click **"Profiler"**.

Check **"ASP.NET Core"** as the application stack and then click the **"Collect .NET Profiler Trace"** button.

![The Collect .NET Profiler Trace Button](the-collect-net-profiler-trace-button.jpg)

The profiler is smart as it is capable of detecting the runtime version of the target .NET Core application. Profiler trace is not enabled by default in versions before 2.2.3. If it is an old version, profiler will list out the changes that are needed, in order to generate the trace.

![Collect Profiler Trace](collect-profiler-trace.jpg)

This workshop's web project has been updated with these code and configuration changes:

* [The code change](https://github.com/4lowTheRabbit/LabHighCpuCoreSite/blob/master/LabHighCpuCoreSite/Program.cs#L24)
* [The configuration change](https://github.com/4lowTheRabbit/LabHighCpuCoreSite/blob/master/LabHighCpuCoreSite/appsettings.json#L4)

A default ASP.NET core project would need to apply these changes first, before we can troubleshoot high CPU issues by profiler.

### Collect the profiler trace

Browse `/repro/enable` again to enable the infinite loop in the code.

Click the **"Collect Profiler Trace"** button to start a new profiling session.

![Collect Profiler Trace Button](collect-profiler-trace-button.jpg)

Hold on when profiler is starting.

![Profiler Step 1](profiler-step1.jpg)

When it shows **"Step 2: Reproduce the issue now"**, browse `/repro/` to reproduce the high CPU issue.

![Profiler Step 2](profiler-step2.jpg)

In about 20 seconds, before it shows **"Step 3:  Stopping profiler"**, browse `/repro/disable` to finish the high CPU request. A request must finish before profiler is shutdown, otherwise we won't see its details in the report.

Wait for the profiler to be stopped and the profiler trace to be generated.

### Read the profiler trace report

Click the report link to pop up the profiler report.

![The Profiler Report Link](the-profiler-report-link.jpg)

Under the **".Net Core Slow Requests"** tab, click the **"Stack Trace"** button of the slow request.

![The Stack Trace button](the-stack-trace-button.jpg)

Move the slide to **".NET Framekwork"**, instead of **"Just My Code"**. The user code is deep under the .Net Framework functions in the invocation tree, so we have to select **".NET Framework"**, in order to see the user function.

![Move the slider](move-the-slider.jpg)

Observe the high CPU user function in the stack tree.

![Invocation Tree](invocation-tree.jpg)

If you see the following message when expanding a stack trace, it should be due to the profiler is stopped before the request finishes.

![Request Not Finished](request-not-finished.jpg)

>Note: The default profiling session duration time is 60 seconds. You can add an Application Setting named ``APPSETTING_IIS_PROFILING_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS`` to change it.

### Decompile the code of ReproController.DoJob() from LabHighCpuCoreSite.dll

Let's go back again to the Kudu site and open **Debug Console** -> **CMD**

CD to `D:\home\site\wwwroot\`, click the download button to download `LabHighCpuCoreSite.dll`

![download LabHighCpuCoreSite.dll](download-dll.jpg)

Download and unzip ILSpy tool from its [Download Page](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/releases) . Launch ILSpy to open `LabHighCpuCoreSite.dll`

>Note: The latest version of ILSpy.exe hides private functions by default. Make sure you have checked "Show internal types and members" from the View menu.

![decompiled code](ilspy.jpg)

## Debug the high CPU process

We cannot hold and debug an issue online for root cause for hours in a production environment. Dump files are captured as snapshots of a process, which can be debugged offline later by WinDBG. 

>Note: Since version 2.2, .NET Core web applications are hosted in w3wp.exe [in-process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/index?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=windows#in-process-hosting-model), instead of [out-of-processs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/index?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=windows#out-of-process-hosting-model) in dotnet.exe previously. If you are not able to debug .NET Core in this scenario, this will be due to WinDBG doesn't load the right debugger extension for .NET core. The steps in 
[Debug .NET Core In-Process Dumps](https://4lowtherabbit.github.io/blogs/2019/02/DebuggingInProcess) can help. 

### Collect the dump file
In the **"Diagnose and solve problems" (DaaS)** blade of the site on the Azure portal, click **"Memory Dump"** in the **"Diagnostic Tools"** tile.

Check **"ASP.NET Core"** as the application stack and then click the **"Collect Memory Dump"** button.

Repro the issue, like we did in the profiler section, by browsing `/repro/enable` first and then `/repro/`

Click **"Collect Memory Dump"** when the page is still loading.

>Note: Usually we capture at least 3 dumps, in interval of one or several minutes. This is because 1 snapshot of a process would be ambiguous to conclude on the root cause of a high CPU issue. As for this workshop, since its simple and CPU is high enough, capturing just 1 dump file should be adequate to find out the root cause.

![Collect Memory Dump](collect-memory-dump.jpg)

The automatically generated dump analysis report doesn't work well for .NET Core dumps, hence we need to download the .dmp file to local and manually debug it.

Click the file link to download the .dmp dump file of the dotnet.exe process.

![Download the Dotnet.exe Dump](download-the-dotnet-dump.jpg)

### Setup WinDBG
Search WinDBG in windows 10's Microsoft store app

![search WinDBG](search-windbg.jpg)

Install and launch the WinDbg app

Open the .dmp dump file by WinDbg

![open dump](open-dump.png)

>Note: This is a 32bit process, since the debugger shows `Free X86 compatible` when loading the dump

Please be patient for WindBG to load all symbol files. It will take a few minutes for the first time when debugging a dump.

![loading symobol](loading-symbol.png)
    
Download the Mex Debugging Extension for WinDbg from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53304

Run it and extract to C:\Debugger\Mex . A zip file will be created there.
 
Then extract the zip file to C:\Debugger\Mex\ . Ensure that you can find mex.dll under folder C:\Debugger\Mex\x86

Run `.load C:\Debugger\Mex\x86\mex.dll` in the command window to load the Mex extension

![load mex](load-mex.png)
 
```
0:000> .load C:\Debugger\Mex\x86\mex.dll
Mex External 3.0.0.7172 Loaded!
```

## Debug the dump file
Run `~*e !clrstack2` to dump out the .Net call stacks of all threads in that process.

* `~*e` means to execute a debugging command to all threads.
* `!clrstack2` is a debugging command of Mex, which can be used to dump out the call stack of a thread.

The high CPU thread's call stack looks like below
```
SP       IP       Function   Source
0babe698 00000000 InlinedCallFrame
0babe694 622303ca DomainNeutralILStubClass.IL_STUB_PInvoke() 
    0babe698 00000000 InlinedCallFrame 
0babe6c8 0b2924fe LabHighCpuCoreSite.Controllers.ReproController.DoJob() 
...
```

## Decompile the code
It is handy to decompile a .NET function by Mex in WinDBG

Add where you extracted ILSpy to the `path` environment variable

![add to path](path.png)

Run `!ilpsy LabHighCpuCoreSite.Controllers.ReproController.DoJob`.
    
Mex will extract HighCPUWebJobDotNet.exe from the dump, launch an ILSpy window to open HighCPUWebJobDotNet.exe, and to show the decompiled code.

Here is its output in my WinDBG:
```
0:000> !ilspy LabHighCpuCoreSite.Controllers.ReproController.DoJob
Scanning for Name or Module address of: LabHighCpuCoreSite.Controllers.ReproController.DoJob
